Abstract: A research was conducted at Gokuleshwor VDC of Darchula district during 2015 to determine the
performance of different substrate for the production of Oyster The research was carried out by growing
florida species of Pleurotus (Oyster Mushroom), on five different substrates namely banana leaves, rice straw,
wheat straw, mixture of rice and wheat straw and saw dust under one factor CRD design with four replication
during summer with an average daily temperature of 260C- 300C and RH ranging from 80 to 100%. Among the
five different treatments banana leaves was found to be suitable as it obtained more total yield per five kg of
substrate i. e. 4.76 kg followed by other substrates. The saw dust gave lowest yield i.e. 0.97 kg which may be
due to presence of different phenolic compounds. The duration of first mycelium colonization, fruiting and
harvesting was shorter in banana leaves followed by other substrates and longer in saw dust. Longer stipe
length was obtained from banana leaves (6.41 cm) and wider Cap diameter was obtained from wheat straw
(9.87 cm) followed by other substrates. Similarly, the maximum final substrate weight per ball was obtained
from saw dust i.e. 4.56 kg followed by other substrates and minimum in banana leaves i.e. 2.12 kg. In
conclusion banana leaves was found best substrate for production of P. florida as it gave the highest B:C ratio
(3.13) followed by rice straw (2.10) among the substrate used.

INTRODUCTION
Mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of macrofungi. They are neither plants nor animals but they have
been placed in a kingdom of their own called the kingdom of Myceteae. The term mushroom resembles to those

fungi that have stem (stipe), cap (pileus), hymenium (lamellae) and spores which are present on the underside
of the cap (Masarirambi et al., 2011). They have heterotrophic mode of nutrition as they lack chlorophyll.
Both edible/medicinal and poisonous species can be categorized under mushroom. In Nepal roughly 110
mushroom species are edible, 45 are toxic and 13 have medicinal value (Poudel and Bajracharya, 2011). In
fiscal year 2013/14 fresh mushroom production was 1900 mt, similarly in fiscal year 2014/15 production was
2700 mt and in fiscal year 2015/16 production was reached to 9300 mt and mushroom seed production in fiscal
year 2013/14, 2014/15 and 2015/16 was 333505, 425000 and 1488000 bottles respectively showing production
of mushroom seed and fresh mushroom in recent years is rapidly increasing (MoAD, 2074; MoAD, 2015/16).
Oyster mushroom (Pleurotus spp.) is very popular edible mushroom due to its excellent flavor and taste. Oyster
mushrooms (Pleurotus spp.) were more recently domesticated, and now rank second in world production and
first rank in Nepal. In Nepal three species of Oyster mushroom namely Pleurotus sajor-kaju P. ostreatus and P.
florida are available. A high nutritional value of dried oyster mushrooms has been reported with protein (2550%), fat (2-5%), sugars (17-47%), mycocellulose (7-38%) and minerals (potassium, phosphorus, calcium,
sodium) of about 8-12% (Stanley, 2011). Edible mushrooms are also rich in vitamins such as niacin, riboflavin,
vitamin D, C, B1, B5 and B6 (Ahmed et al., 2009).
o

The different species of Pleurotus normally grow within a temperature range from 15-25 C and on
various agricultural waste materials as substrate (Hasan et al., 2010). Although Pleurotus is leading mushroom
in country most of the production relies on P. sajor-kaju and is only confined in winter season. Still there is
very negligible supply of oyster mushroom in summer season although the demand is increasing day by day.
So, P. florida; a species of oyster mushroom growing easily in warmer condition may be the best alternative for
the year round supply of Oyster mushroom supporting summer season. P. florida gives the highest yield at 30
o

C and is preferred for summer season cultivation (Uddin et al., 2010). It can be grown on substrates rich in

cellulose hemicellulose and lignin such as agro byproducts like rice straw, wheat straw, leaves and banana
leaves, saw dust, sugarcane baggase, corncob, waste papers etc.
In Nepal although Plant Pathology Division (PPD) introduced cultivation technology of Oyster
mushrooms in 1981 the growth rate of this sector is not satisfactory. Most of farmers are confined to winter
season for mushroom cultivation using rice straw as they are not familiar with efficiency and methods of
Pleurotus mushroom production using other agro byproducts. Pleurotus cultivation is bioconversion exercise
which greatly reduces pollution and is an efficient source of protein. In tune with the contemporary problem the
present study was carried out to evaluate the performance of different agro based residues on the yield
performance of Pleurotus mushroom and to find out the benefit cost ratio of Pleurotus florida mushroom
production using different substrates specially in summer season.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A field experiment was carried out at Gokuleshwor bazaar of Darchula district of Nepal during 5 August
to 15 November 2015. The experiment was conducted in completely randomized design (CRD) with 5
treatments and 4 replications. Thus, there were altogether 20 bags each of 5kg and variety used was Pleurotus
florida.
The treatments consisted of rice straw (t1), wheat straw (t2), 1:1 mixture of rice straw and wheat straw
(t3), banana leaves (t4) and saw dust (t5) as substrates. These substrates were chopped into small pieces of 1-2
inch (if required), overnight soaked, thoroughly washed with clean water and excess water was allowed to drain
down so that water didn’t ooze out when squeezed with hand. Then each substrate were individually sterilized
by steam using metallic drum for 2 to 3 hrs and were allowed to cool to normal temperature or 20-250c, which
was then filled into plastic bags of size 16’’X24’’ making five layer each of 5 kg. Spawning was done at
periphery of each layer with 20 gm in lower four layers and 25 gm in uppermost layer, then after the bags were
tied at the mouth and few holes were made for aeration around the periphery plastic bag and were incubated in
o

dark and ventilated room at around 30 C.
After the substrates were fully colonized with mycelium then the plastics were removed and each ball was
established into wooden platform in dispersed light condition for growing mushroom. Watering was done in 2-3
times a day depending upon substrate and temperature after 7-10 days fruiting bodies were appeared which
were ready for harvest in further 3-5 days. In the similar second and third harvests were taken. Then number of
days to full colonization, number of days to first fruiting, harvesting duration, total mushroom yield, mushroom
pileus diameter, stipe length and final substrate weight were observed and B:C ratio was calculated. Observed
data were then analyzed by using M-stat-c. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test differences among
the treatments and means were separated using Duncan’s multiple range test (DMRT) at the 5 % level of
significance.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Five different types of substrates were compared with respect to production of Oyster mushroom. The
various substrates used in this study showed variation in spawn run, duration of first fruiting, days to harvests,
stipe length, pielus diameter, total yield and final substrate weight.

Effect of different substrates on 1st colonization duration, 1st fruiting duration, 1st harvest duration, 1st
yield, 1st harvest stipe length and 1st harvest cap diameter of oyster mushroom
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed highly significant results among the tested substrates (p≤0.01) in first
colonization, first fruiting, first harvest duration, first harvest yield, first harvest stipe length and cap diameter.
Banana leaves required least time for mycelium colonization (18.5 days) followed by rice straw (21 days),
wheat straw (21.5 days), mixture of rice and wheat straw (22.75 days) and longest duration was required for
saw dust (42 days). Similarly, first fruiting and first harvest was also found to be faster in banana leaves (19.5
and 23 days) followed by rice straw (23 and 26.25 days), respectively. Highest fruiting and harvest duration
was recorded in saw dust (44 and 50.25 days) respectively. In case of yield from first harvest higher yield was
obtained from banana leaves (530 gm) followed by rice straw (463.8 gm), wheat straw (390 gm), mixture of
rice and wheat (373.8 gm) and the lowest yield was obtained from saw dust (98.75 gm). In case of stipe length
from first harvest was obtained in banana leaves (6.76 cm) followed by wheat straw (6.62 cm), mixture of rice
and wheat straw (6.07 cm), rice straw (6.02 cm) and shortest was obtained from saw dust (4.6 cm). For cap
diameter, it was found highest from wheat straw (9.87 cm) followed by banana leaves (9.17 cm), rice straw
(8.96 cm), mixture of rice and wheat straw (8.11 cm) and lowest in saw dust (7.14 cm) under similar
environment (Table 1)
Mondal et al., (2010) found similar result according to him, the presence of right proportion of alpha-cellulose,
hemicellulose and lignin is responsible for higher mycelium running rate in banana leaves and rice straw and
for the higher mycelial growth in banana leaves and rice straw the suitable C: N ratio might be responsible
which in turn gives higher yield. Lower mycelium running rate aggravates for lower yield in saw dust which
might be due to presence of various kinds of polyphenolic substances, low content of cellulose and low
moisture holding capacity. Similar result was found by Chang & Quimio (1982) and (Gohl, 1993). The type of
agricultural wastes, single or mixtures of two different agricultural wastes used in preparing the farm substrates
may be responsible for change in the stipe length, pileus width and overall yield of the mushrooms grown in the
different farm substrates. Similar result was found by Chukwurah (2013). Also the major ecological factors
such as temperature, humidity, fresh air and compact material affect stalk height, stalk diameter and cap size in
mushroom (AMGA, 2004).

Effect of different substrates on mean yield and final substrate weight of Oyster mushroom
Analysis of variance showed highly significant result (p≤0.01) between the final mean yield and final substrate
weight of oyster mushroom between the different substrate used as treatments. Highest final mean yield was
obtained by banana leaves (1190 gm) followed by rice straw (973.8 gm), wheat straw (832.5 gm) and mixture
of rice and wheat straw (826.3 gm) respectively. The lowest final yield of oyster mushroom was obtained by
saw dust (242.5 gm). In case of final substrate weight of banana leaves had lowest weight (2.12 kg) followed by
rice straw+wheat straw mix (2.98 kg), rice straw (3.05 kg), wheat straw (3.30 kg) and highest in saw dust (4.56
kg) (Table.2). This suggests that the substrate which is used more by enzymatic activity of fungus gives more
yields but in case of mix substrate the result didn’t satisfy this as water holding capacity of mixture was
relatively low. Thus, it indicates that higher percentage of biological use efficiency of banana leaves substrate
According to Mamiro and Mamiro (2011) the reason for higher yield from banana leaves rather than
rice straw may be due to the high water holding capacity of banana leaves. Different kinds of polyphenolic
substances in saw dust may results the lowest mycelium running rate (Chang & Quimio, 1982).

B-C Ratio:
It is defined as the ratio of gross benefit from selling of output to the total cost incurred during production. If
B:C is greater than 1, the project is accepted and vice-versa. Higher value of B:C indicates higher level of
feasibility of the project in economical aspect. In our study, B-C ratio of different treatments was as follows:
t1-Rice straw= 1167/555=2.10
t2-Wheat straw=999/505=1.97
t3-Mix of rice & wheat straw=990/530=1.86
t4-Banana leaves= 1428/455=3.13
t5-Saw dust= 291/475=0.62
Benefit- Cost result showed that higher economic benefit was obtained from use of banana leaves as
substrate for cultivation of P. florida with highest B: C ratio (3.13) followed by rice straw (2.10), wheat
straw(1.97) and mixture of rice and wheat straw (1.97). But B: C was found less than 1 in case of saw dust
(0.62) indicating some problems in gaining yield with respect to cost expense. Similar, results was found by
Mamiro and Mamiro (2011). The low yield in saw dust might be due to lowest mycelium running rate which
might be due to presence of different kinds of polyphenolic substances, low content of cellulose and low
moisture holding capacity. Similar result was found by Chang & Quimio (1982) and (Gohl, 1993).
CONCLUSION
From the results obtained through our research banana leaves is more efficient for the production of Pleurotus
florida mushroom in summer season as compared to rice straw, wheat straw, mixture of rice and wheat straw

and saw dust as the total yield and B:C ratio both are higher in case of banana leaves than others. So, banana
leaves could be one of the best substrate for production of Pleurotus florida mushroom in summer which will
reduce the short supply of mushroom during summer condition and may also provides reasonable price to the
farmers.
